            Software: Photoshop

            Description:

            I chose these images because I’ve always liked images and the idea of space and one of the things that remind me of myself and good times with my family are stars and star gazing. I also like to make art, so I used an old self portrait I created and edited it since it’s a better representation of myself then a selfie would be. The background of the piece is a photo I took when I was in the tropics (where my family is from) and the day I took it is a nice memory of mine. I find it hard to work with Photoshop and just getting it to do what I wanted was a struggle sometimes, but I overall like what I ended up with.

        <p>Title: Self in Shades of Gray
            <br>
            Semester/Year: 2020
            <br>
            Software: Illustrator
            <br>
            Description: I usually prefer to depict myself in shades of gray so I did that here. This is partially due to having oddly toned skin, so it’s hard to get coloration to look or feel right to me. I drew myself based on how I tend to currently appear (at least in school) rather than on how I sometimes look. It just felt right to draw myself that way for this part of the project. I wasn't quite sure how to get my eyes to look right but I feel like I got close to what they look like.

            I did not use any outside pictures in this part of the process.</p>

            <br>
            Semester/Year: 2020
            <br>
            Software: Audacity
            <br>
            This takes place in my neighborhood 10 years ago. It used to be kind of a bad place to live but it's gotten better over time. I didn't want to do something that sounded horrific, but I couldn't figure out how to do the thing I wanted to do, which sounded peaceful (a walk in Grenada), so I went with something near the middle and close to home. I imagine this audio to be on the last block of the walk.
            <br>
            It's not scary (at least not to me), but I recommend playing it initially at a low volume as some sounds may be surprising.</p>

            Description:
            The General concept is calmness and simplicity. I wanted to have something the user could interact with simply and have both a big and small effect on. It's inspired by a project I did previously, I chose circles and squares because their shape allows for a nice looking arrangement. The user can interact with the program in two ways, Depending on the position of the mouse the user will alter the color of the two patterns. If the user clicks and hold their mouse the patterns spin. The most challenging part of this was figuring out what to do. The file we were suppose to download didn't cooperate with my computer so I had to just kind of go off the requirements listed above and I'm a bit worried about that.</p>

            Software: Photoshop (and Fire Alpaca)
            <br>
            Description:
            I decided to make a gif of an omniscient eye looking over different places/views. I liked the idea and thought it would be visually interesting. I tried to think of interesting views I could incorporate, and I got to do the ones i like most, but not all. (I wanted to do 5 views but only got to do 3). The most challenging part of the project was trying to get Photoshop to work and do what i want to do. It was quite infuriating, but I did manage to get my work finished in a different program (Fire Alpaca) and then arrange it in Photoshop. I'm happy with what I got, but I'm actually not sure how long it is or if it's long enough. It took more then a day to get it done so I hope it is.</p>

            I wanted my site to be nice to look at and read, so I tried to put in a nice background that reminds me of home and I wrote it in basically my tone of voice. The background picture unfortunately didn't work well on the gallery page, but I'm satisfied with it's look on the homepage. The most challenging part of the project was getting my computer to handle running the programs I would need without freezing or going black, but I managed it. Figuring out some of the code was kinda tricky too, but I got it in the end.</p>

            <br>
            Software: Photoshop (and Fire Alpaca)
            <br>
            Description:
            I decided to animate "contentment" because it's an emotion that most people seek to feel. It's also an emotion I really enjoy feeling. I've found that I can be content by just enjoying someone's presence for a while, ususally while enjoying a nice view and maybe while having a nice relaxed discussion, so that's what i decided to animate. I found the colors to be reminescent of a cityscape and sky during twilight, so those are the colors I decided to use throughout the piece. The most challenging part of the project was being unable to use After Effects. It just refused to work well with my computer so I had to give up on using it, and opt for photoshop and a drawing program instead. I think the piece came out pretty well, though I do wish I could incoporate sound into it.

            <br>
            Description:
            I chose food insecurity and food waste because they are both important issues in our society that get little attention. Also, If connected in the right way, these two problems can be used to solve eachother. I tried to pick media that conveyed the main ideas of each section they were in. I had a bit of trouble finding good photos, but I'm satisfied with the ones I used. I also had a bit of a tough time finding good info but with, but I think I managed to do that. I chose to make the background green because it's a color usaually associated with plants, food, healing, helping and the enviornment. All of these things relate to my social cause in one way or another. I think the public would react postively to my website. I made sure to link some good organizations and sites that I think would be helpful to most viewers of the site. I aslo think I presented the information on my site pretty well.
