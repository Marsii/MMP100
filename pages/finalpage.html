    <h1>Food Insecurity and Waste</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h4>Both Food Insecurity and Food Waste are major problems in America. Oddly enough the possibility exist that these problems can solve eachother. On this site, I hope to educate you on both of these issues.</h4>

    <h3>Food Insecurity</h3>
    <p>Food Insecurity effects a significant amount of the population. Around 15% of all households in the US are food insecure. Of this 15%, 10% have low food security and 5% have very low food security. In certain minority groups, the percent of insecurity is higher. Around 13% of households with children are food insecure. Nearly 30% of households headed by single women, around 16% of housesholds headed by single men and around 13% of people who live alone are all food insecure. are also food insecure.

        Food Insecurity can have serious health complications, especially when people facing hunger are forced to choose between spending money on food and medicine or medical care. It can also damage a childâ€™s ability to learn and grow and add more stress to a household that may already be wrestling with instability and unpredictability.

        During Corona, food insecurity has been on the rise due to many people being layed off or fired, whichs leaves many to have limited funds to spend on neccessities. In our city, the Food Bank for New York City has been working to serve the community and food those without, however the surge for demand has caused quite a few difficulties.

    <h3>Food Waste</h3>
    <p>In the United States, food waste is estimated at between 30-40 percent of the food supply. This estimate, of food loss at the retail and consumer levels, corresponded to approximately 133 billion pounds and $161 billion worth of food in 2010.

        Not only is this food being wasted but it means that good food that could be given to people who need it end up in landfills, and a countless amount of labor, water and energy is being used to dispose of this discarded food.

        <br>
        Since the Corona pandemic, food waste has increased significantly. Due to the closure of restaurants, hotels and schools huge sources of demand for fresh food has disappeared, leaving farmers with millions of pounds of excess they can not currently sell off. Although this rise in waste is starting to decline for some food, and some farmers have been able to donate to food banks, many farmers are still struggling to find new buyers.
