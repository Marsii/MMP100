    <h4>A bit about me</h4>
    <h5>Hello, My name is Naomi Marshall</h5>
    <p> There's a lot I like to do, but lately I like to bake, draw and cook in my spare time. I also quite like to read about emerging tech, research issues and learn about what causes them, and learn about various topics.</p> 
    <br>   
    <p>For my career I hope to help create technologies that help people and improves lives. I've done a few projects related to this goal, but have yet to make anything I could release. I'm working to get a point where I can.</p>
